# Error Reference

When an engine fails, Untether scans the error message and shows an actionable recovery hint above the raw error. The raw error is wrapped in a code block for visual separation.

This page lists all recognised error patterns grouped by category. Hints are matched by substring (case-insensitive) — first match wins.
