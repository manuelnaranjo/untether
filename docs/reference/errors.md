# Error Reference

When an engine fails, Untether scans the error message and shows an actionable recovery hint above the raw error. The raw error is wrapped in a code block for visual separation.

This page lists all recognised error patterns grouped by category, in the order they are checked. Hints are matched by substring (case-insensitive) — first match wins, so the order is part of the behaviour.

## Engine end-of-life and CLI flag drift

These are checked first. The end-of-life patterns must outrank the generic `invalid_request_error` pattern, which AMP's `426` payload would otherwise match with a misleading hint ([#721](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/721)); the Codex retired-setting pattern must outrank the generic `no longer supported` fallback, which would otherwise blame the client version ([#830](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/830)).

| Pattern | Hint | Engines |
|---------|------|---------|
| `ineligibletiererror` / `gemini code assist for individuals` | Gemini CLI is end-of-life for individual and free Google accounts (18 June 2026). The `gemini` engine is deprecated in Untether — switch engines via /config, or migrate to Antigravity CLI (antigravity.google). | Gemini (deprecated) |
| `this version of amp is no longer supported` | AMP is refusing this client version. Run `amp update` to upgrade. The `amp` engine is deprecated in Untether and may stop working again without notice. | AMP (deprecated) |
| `is no longer supported; remove this setting` | A setting in your Codex config (`~/.codex/config.toml`, a `--profile` file, or `[engines.codex] extra_args`) is no longer supported by the installed Codex CLI — remove the key the error names. | Codex |
| `' for '--` / `a value is required for '--` / `error: unexpected argument '-` | The engine CLI rejected a command-line flag — this Untether version may not match the installed CLI. Update Untether, and report it if the problem persists. | Codex (clap argv errors) |
| `no longer supported` | The engine CLI reports that this client version or account tier is no longer supported by its provider. Update the CLI, or switch engines via /config. | All |

| `too many requests` | Rate limited — the engine will retry automatically. | All |

## Model errors

| Pattern | Hint | Engines |
|---------|------|---------|
| `model_not_found` | Model not available. Check the model name in `/config`. | All |
| `invalid_model` | Model not available. Check the model name in `/config`. | All |
| `model not available` | Model not available. Check the model name in `/config`. | All |
| `does not exist` | The requested resource was not found. Check your model or configuration. | All |

## Context length

| Pattern | Hint | Engines |
|---------|------|---------|

| `max_tokens` | Token limit exceeded. Start a fresh session with `/new`. | Claude, Codex, OpenCode |
| `context window` | Session context is too long. Start a fresh session with `/new`. | Claude, Codex, OpenCode |

| `prompt_blocked` | Request blocked by content safety filter. Try rephrasing your prompt. | Antigravity |
| `safety_block` | Request blocked by content safety filter. Try rephrasing your prompt. | Antigravity |

## Reasoning level

These are checked before the generic `invalid_request_error` pattern, because the same 400 carries that type too. The hints are engine-neutral: `reasoning.effort` is an OpenAI Responses-API parameter, so an OpenCode run on an OpenAI provider can hit it as well.

| Pattern | Hint | Engines |
|---------|------|---------|
| `cannot be used with reasoning.effort` | The model's reasoning level can't be combined with a tool that is switched on (usually web search). Raise the reasoning level: in /config → Reasoning if this engine offers it there, otherwise in the engine's own config file (for Codex, model_reasoning_effort in ~/.codex/config.toml). | Codex, OpenCode (OpenAI) |
| `reasoning.effort` | The model doesn't accept this reasoning level. Choose another one: in /config → Reasoning if this engine offers it there, otherwise in the engine's own config file (for Codex, model_reasoning_effort in ~/.codex/config.toml). | Codex, OpenCode (OpenAI) |

## Invalid request

| Pattern | Hint | Engines |
|---------|------|---------|
| `invalid_request_error` | The API rejected the request (invalid_request_error) — the error below says why. Check the model and reasoning settings in /config; if they look right, update the engine CLI. | Claude, Codex |

| `readtimeout` | Connection timed out — usually transient. Try again. | All |
| `name or service not known` | DNS resolution failed — check your network connection. | All |
| `network is unreachable` | Network is unreachable — check your internet connection. | All |
| `certificate verify failed` | SSL certificate verification failed. Check network, proxy, or certificates. | All |
| `ssl handshake` | SSL/TLS handshake failed. Check network, proxy, or certificates. | All |

| `sigkill` | The process was forcefully terminated (timeout or out of memory). Resume by sending a new message. | All |
| `sigabrt` | The process aborted unexpectedly. Try starting a fresh session with `/new`. | All |

## Process and execution errors

| Pattern | Hint | Engines |
|---------|------|---------|
| `error_during_execution` | The session could not be loaded. Send `/new` to start a fresh session. | Claude |
| `finished without a result event` | The engine exited before producing a final answer. Try sending a new message to resume. | All |
| `finished but no session_id` | The engine crashed during startup. Check that the CLI is installed and working. | All |

## Engine-specific errors

| Pattern | Hint | Engines |
|---------|------|---------|
