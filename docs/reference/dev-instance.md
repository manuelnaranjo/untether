# Dev Instance

The release pipeline uses two isolated Untether instances on lba-1: **staging** (PyPI/TestPyPI release) and **dev** (local editable source). They use separate Telegram bots, separate configs, and separate state — zero crosstalk.

> **Fleet context:** lba-1 staging is one of **five production-ish hosts** (lba-1, nsd, channelo, sl, mac). Multi-host upgrades use `scripts/fleet-rollout.sh` — see [release-discipline.md → Fleet rollout](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/blob/dev/.claude/rules/release-discipline.md#fleet-rollout-rc-and-stable). This page covers the lba-1 staging/dev pair specifically.

> **Other lba-1 instances:** three special-purpose services also run on lba-1 — `untether-demo.service` (screenshot demo bot, `~/.untether-demo/`), `untether-dev-hf.service` (handoff/stateless-mode testing, `~/.untether-dev-hf/`) and `untether-dev-ws.service` (workspace-mode testing, `~/.untether-dev-ws/`). All three run the **same editable `.venv` as dev**, so a source change reaches them too when they restart. The release pipeline and integration tests use only staging and dev.

## How it works

| | Staging | Dev |
|---|---|---|
| **Systemd service** | `untether.service` | `untether-dev.service` |
| **Binary** | `~/.local/bin/untether` (pipx, PyPI wheel) | `/home/nathan/untether/.venv/bin/untether` (editable) |
| **Config** | `~/.untether/untether.toml` | `~/.untether-dev/untether.toml` |
| **State files** | `~/.untether/*.json` | `~/.untether-dev/*.json` |
| **Lock file** | `~/.untether/untether.lock` | `~/.untether-dev/untether.lock` |
| **Telegram bot** | `@hetz_lba1_bot` | `@untether_dev_bot` |
| **Source** | PyPI release or TestPyPI rc | Whatever's in `/home/nathan/untether/src/` |

The `UNTETHER_CONFIG_PATH` env var (set in the dev systemd unit) is what directs the dev instance to its own config directory. State and lock files derive their paths from the config file location automatically (the lock is `config_path.with_suffix(".lock")` — see `src/untether/lockfile.py`).

## Why no separate repo or branch?

The dev instance doesn't need its own branch or repo. The separation is at the **runtime** level, not the source level:

- **Staging** runs a PyPI/TestPyPI wheel — changing local source has zero effect on it
- **Dev** runs the local editable install — any code change takes effect on `systemctl --user restart untether-dev`
- You develop on whatever branch you like (master, feature branches, etc.)
- The `~/.untether-dev/` config directory is local infrastructure, not versioned in git

## Quick reference

```bash
# --- Dev instance ---
systemctl --user restart untether-dev     # Pick up code changes
systemctl --user stop untether-dev
journalctl --user -u untether-dev -f      # Tail dev logs

# --- Staging instance ---
systemctl --user restart untether         # Restart (same wheel version)
journalctl --user -u untether -f          # Tail staging logs

# --- Staging: install rc from TestPyPI ---
scripts/staging.sh install X.Y.ZrcN
systemctl --user restart untether

# --- Staging: upgrade after PyPI release ---
scripts/staging.sh reset       # or: pipx upgrade untether
systemctl --user restart untether

# --- Check both ---
systemctl --user status untether untether-dev

# --- Versions ---
/home/nathan/.local/bin/untether --version          # Staging (PyPI/TestPyPI)
/home/nathan/untether/.venv/bin/untether --version   # Dev (local)
```

## Dev workflow

1. Edit code in `/home/nathan/untether/src/`
2. `systemctl --user restart untether-dev`
3. Test via `@untether_dev_bot` in Telegram
4. Run tests: `uv run pytest`
5. When satisfied: commit, push, enter staging

## Staging workflow

After dev testing passes, release candidates go to TestPyPI and then, once the integration-test attestation is written, to all five hosts in parallel (lba-1 staging, nsd, channelo, sl, mac) before publishing to PyPI. There is no separate dogfood window: the integration tests are the quality gate, and the fleet soak (`/monitor`, issue watcher) catches what they miss.

```
Dev (local editable)     Staging (TestPyPI rc)           Release (PyPI)
@untether_dev_bot        @hetz_lba1_bot                  (staging bot)

Fix bugs, test locally   Bump to 0.35.0rc1               Bump to 0.35.0
Integration tests        Merge to dev → TestPyPI         PR dev → master, merge
                         Attest integration tests         auto-tag-on-master.yml → release.yml → PyPI
                         fleet-rollout.sh 0.35.0rc1       fleet-rollout.sh 0.35.0 (5 hosts)
                         Issue watcher catches bugs
                         Fix → 0.35.0rc2 if needed
```

### Enter staging

1. Bump version in `pyproject.toml` to `X.Y.Zrc1` (no changelog entry needed)
2. Run `uv lock` to sync lockfile
3. Commit on a feature branch: `chore: staging X.Y.Zrc1`
4. PR to `dev` and merge — push to `dev` auto-publishes to TestPyPI via CI
5. Wait for CI to pass
6. Install on staging bot:
   ```bash
   scripts/staging.sh install X.Y.Zrc1
   systemctl --user restart untether
   scripts/healthcheck.sh --version X.Y.Zrc1
   ```
7. To put the rc on **all five hosts**, attest the integration-test run first
   (`scripts/run-integration-tests.sh X.Y.Zrc1 --manual`), then run
   `scripts/fleet-rollout.sh X.Y.Zrc1` and the [`/ping` sweep](fleet-ping-verification.md).

### Fix bugs during staging

1. Fix on a feature branch, PR to `dev`, merge
2. Bump to `X.Y.Zrc2`, run `uv lock`, commit, push (same dev cycle)
3. CI publishes the new rc to TestPyPI on the dev push
4. `scripts/staging.sh install X.Y.Zrc2 && systemctl --user restart untether`

### Promote to release (single-gate flow)

1. Bump to `X.Y.Z` in `pyproject.toml` (drop the rc suffix)
2. Add full changelog entry covering all changes since last stable release
3. Run `uv lock`, commit on a feature branch
4. PR `dev` → `master`. Nathan reviews and squash-merges — **this is the single release gate**
5. `auto-tag-on-master.yml` detects the stable version and creates `vX.Y.Z`; `release.yml` fires on the tag, runs full CI, publishes to PyPI via OIDC, and creates the GitHub Release. **No manual tag, no PyPI environment approval.**
6. After PyPI publishes: attest and run `scripts/fleet-rollout.sh X.Y.Z` (all five hosts), or for lba-1 staging alone `scripts/staging.sh reset && systemctl --user restart untether`

### Rollback from staging

If a staging rc is too broken:

```bash
scripts/staging.sh rollback
systemctl --user restart untether
```

This reinstalls the last stable PyPI version.

### Conventions

- **rc versions are NOT git-tagged** — avoids triggering `release.yml`
- **No changelog for rc** — changelog is written once for the final release
- **Commit message**: `chore: staging X.Y.ZrcN`
- **Issue watcher** works identically during staging (monitors the same staging service)
- **`validate_release.py`** skips changelog validation for pre-release versions

## Config files

**Dev config** (`~/.untether-dev/untether.toml`): Minimal config with the dev bot token and test chat routes. Edit directly — not version-controlled.

**Dev systemd unit** (`~/.config/systemd/user/untether-dev.service`): Sets `UNTETHER_CONFIG_PATH` and points `ExecStart` at the local `.venv`. Run `systemctl --user daemon-reload` after editing.

## Test project directories

Six dev-bot test workspaces live under `test-projects/` in the repo (gitignored, not version-controlled):

| Directory | Engine | Dev config route |
|-----------|--------|-----------------|
| `test-projects/test-claude/` | Claude Code | `[projects.claude-test]` |
| `test-projects/test-codex/` | Codex | `[projects.codex-test]` |
| `test-projects/test-opencode/` | OpenCode | `[projects.opencode-test]` |
| `test-projects/test-pi/` | Pi | `[projects.pi-test]` |
| `test-projects/test-antigravity/` | Antigravity CLI | `[projects.antigravity-test]` |
| `test-projects/test-amp/` | AMP (deprecated) | `[projects.amp-test]` |

Each has a `CLAUDE.md` and `.claude/settings.json`. They're throwaway workspaces — agents run here during dev testing so untether source isn't accidentally modified.

!!! warning "Gemini CLI and AMP are deprecated"
    Both engines still load but are unsupported and are **removed in 0.36.0**. Their routes remain in the dev config, but they are excluded from every integration-test tier — see [integration-testing.md](integration-testing.md).

### Telegram groups

Each test project has a dedicated Telegram group (all in the `ut-dev` folder):

| Group | Chat ID | Engine |
|-------|---------|--------|
| ut-dev: claude | `-5284581592` | Claude Code |
| ut-dev: codex | `-4929463515` | Codex |
| ut-dev: opencode | `-5200822877` | OpenCode |
| ut-dev: pi | `-5156256333` | Pi |
| ut-dev: antigravity | `-5207762142` | Antigravity CLI |
| ut-dev: amp | `-5230875989` | AMP (deprecated) |

Main dev chat (private): `8351408485` (direct messages to `@untether_dev_bot`)

### Adding more routes

To add another test route:
1. Create a Telegram group and add `@untether_dev_bot`
2. Get the chat_id from dev logs: `journalctl --user -u untether-dev -f`
3. Add a `[projects.name]` section to `~/.untether-dev/untether.toml`
4. Create a workspace directory under `test-projects/`
5. Restart dev: `systemctl --user restart untether-dev`

## Systemd service configuration

An example service file lives at `contrib/untether.service`. Seven settings are
critical — two for systemd readiness notification, two for graceful shutdown,
two for OOM (out-of-memory) behaviour, plus `RestartSec`:

```ini
Type=notify             # Untether sends READY=1 after first getUpdates succeeds
NotifyAccess=main       # Only the main process can send sd_notify messages
KillMode=mixed          # SIGTERM main process first, then SIGKILL remaining cgroup
TimeoutStopSec=150      # Give the 120s drain timeout room to complete
RestartSec=2            # Restart quickly after drain completes
OOMScoreAdjust=-100     # Don't be earlyoom's preferred victim
OOMPolicy=continue      # Don't tear down the whole unit on a single OOM kill
```

### Readiness (`Type=notify`)

!!! info "New in v0.35.1"

`Type=notify` tells systemd the bot is "activating" until Untether sends a
`READY=1` datagram to `$NOTIFY_SOCKET` — which only happens after the first
`getUpdates` call succeeds. This prevents the previous race where `systemctl
start` returned "active" before the bot was actually polling. On shutdown,
Untether sends `STOPPING=1` at the start of drain so `systemctl status` shows
"Deactivating" rather than "Active" during the drain window.

The `sd_notify` integration uses the standard library only (no external
dependency). Missing `NOTIFY_SOCKET` (e.g. running outside systemd) is a
silent no-op. See `src/untether/sdnotify.py` and issue #287.

### Restart timing

!!! info "New in v0.35.1"

`RestartSec=2` (down from systemd's default) lets Untether resume polling
within a few seconds of drain completion. The Telegram `update_id` offset is
persisted to `last_update_id.json` on shutdown, so no messages are dropped
or re-processed across the restart window (Telegram retains undelivered
updates for 24 hours). See issue #287.

### Graceful shutdown

`KillMode=mixed` sends SIGTERM only to the main Untether process first, allowing
the drain mechanism to gracefully finish active runs. After the main process
exits, systemd sends SIGKILL to all remaining processes in the cgroup — cleaning
up orphaned MCP servers, containers, or other long-lived children instantly.

Other modes have drawbacks:

- `process` — SIGTERM main only, but orphaned children (MCP servers, Podman containers) survive across restarts, accumulating memory
- `control-group` — SIGTERM **all** processes simultaneously, bypassing the drain mechanism entirely and killing active engine sessions (rc=143); long-lived children with restart policies can cause a 150s restart delay

Without `TimeoutStopSec=150`, systemd's default 90s timeout may kill
the process before the 120s drain finishes.

### OOM (out-of-memory) behaviour

By default, systemd user services inherit `OOMScoreAdjust=100` or `200` from
`user@UID.service` and use `OOMPolicy=stop`. Without overrides, this makes
Untether's Claude subprocesses **preferred victims** for earlyoom and the
kernel OOM killer — ahead of CLI `claude` running in tmux (`oom_score_adj=0`)
and any orphaned grandchildren the user has spawned from a shell session. When
RAM exhaustion hits, the result is that live Telegram chats die with rc=143
(SIGTERM) while the processes actually eating the RAM survive.

`OOMScoreAdjust=-100` lowers Untether's OOM priority. Unprivileged user
processes can only raise their own `oom_score_adj`, not lower it below the
parent's baseline — so the kernel silently clamps the effective value at the
parent's setting (typically 100 on default installs). The `-100` request is
still worth keeping: it documents intent and takes effect if the parent
`user@UID.service` is ever overridden to a lower baseline. See `#275` and
`#222` for the full diagnosis.

`OOMPolicy=continue` tells systemd **not** to tear down the entire unit when
a single child process is OOM-killed. The default (`stop`) cascades SIGTERM
to all active engine subprocesses, breaking every live chat at once. With
`continue`, a single dead MCP server or a single killed engine subprocess is
reported as a clean failure on that one run; the bridge and other active
chats keep running.

Optional system-wide companion override (requires root) — lowers the baseline
for *all* user services to `-200`, which lets Untether's `-100` actually take
effect. Only apply if you want Untether's children to live *longer* than
other unprivileged user processes, including CLI claude:

```bash
sudo systemctl edit user@1000.service   # adjust UID for your host
# add:
[Service]
OOMScoreAdjust=-200
```

This affects every user service on the host — use judgment.

### To apply:

```bash
cp contrib/untether.service ~/.config/systemd/user/untether.service
systemctl --user daemon-reload
systemctl --user restart untether
```

The same settings should be applied to `untether-dev.service`.

!!! note "lba-1's own units"
    The live lba-1 units (`~/.config/systemd/user/untether.service` and `untether-dev.service`)
    predate the v0.35.1 example: they still use `Type=simple` and `RestartSec=10`, with
    `KillMode=mixed`, `TimeoutStopSec=150`, `OOMScoreAdjust=-100` and `OOMPolicy=continue`.
    Staging also has a `memory-cap.conf` drop-in (`MemoryMax=14G`). The demo, dev-hf and
    dev-ws units use `KillMode=process` / `control-group` and no OOM overrides.
