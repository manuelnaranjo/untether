# Agent preamble

Untether injects a context preamble at the start of the prompt for every new run (including a resumed session), telling the engine it's running via Telegram and requesting structured end-of-task summaries. Follow-ups and steers sent into a Claude session that is still open don't repeat it; the session already has it. This works across all engines (Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, Pi, Antigravity CLI, and the deprecated Amp).

## What the default preamble does

The built-in preamble tells the agent:

1. **Context** — it's running via Untether on Telegram, and the user is on a mobile device
2. **Visibility constraints** — only final assistant text is visible; tool calls, thinking blocks, and terminal output are invisible to the user
3. **Summary format** — every response that completes work should end with a short structured summary (about 500–1,500 characters) including "Completed", "Next Steps", and "Decisions Needed" sections, plus how to send files back through `.untether-outbox/` (this part is included even when `[transports.telegram.files] enabled = false`; use a custom `text` if you don't want it)
4. **Config changes** — Untether hot-reloads `untether.toml`, so the agent must not restart the Untether service after editing it (a restart from inside the session drops its own final answer)
5. **Plan mode** — the `ExitPlanMode` plan should be a 3–5 bullet summary, and the reply after approval a brief summary rather than a re-paste of the plan

This means agents naturally produce mobile-friendly summaries instead of expecting the user to read terminal output or file diffs.

## Disable the preamble

If you don't want Untether to inject any preamble:

=== "toml"

    ```toml
    [preamble]
    enabled = false
    ```

## Customise the preamble

Replace the default text with your own:

=== "toml"

    ```toml
    [preamble]
    enabled = true
    text = "You are running via Telegram. Keep responses concise and use bullet points."
    ```

Set `text` to your custom string. When `text` is `null` (the default), Untether uses the built-in preamble. Setting `text` to an empty string (`""`) effectively disables the preamble while keeping the `enabled` flag on.

## Configuration reference

| Key | Type | Default | Notes |
|-----|------|---------|-------|
| `enabled` | bool | `true` | Inject preamble into prompts |
| `text` | string or null | `null` | Custom preamble text; `null` uses the built-in default |

## Ask mode interaction

Untether appends one more line to the preamble, the built-in one or your own `text`. Unless ask mode is turned off in `/config`, the line encourages the agent to use `AskUserQuestion` with structured options; with ask mode off it tells the agent not to ask and to proceed with defaults instead. The line is added for every engine, although only Claude Code turns those questions into buttons.

## Hook awareness

Claude Code plugins can install hooks that fire at session end (Stop hooks). In a terminal, these are harmless — the user can scroll up. But in Telegram, only the final assistant message is visible. If a Stop hook causes Claude to spend its final response addressing hook concerns, the user's actual content is lost.

Untether addresses this in two ways:

1. **Preamble guidance** — the default preamble includes: "If hooks fire at session end, your final response MUST still contain the user's requested content. Hook concerns are secondary."

2. **`UNTETHER_SESSION` env var** — the Claude runner sets `UNTETHER_SESSION=1` in the subprocess environment. Well-behaved Claude Code plugins check for this variable and skip blocking hooks in Telegram sessions. For example, [PitchDocs](https://github.com/littlebearapps/lba-plugins) context-guard detects `$UNTETHER_SESSION` and allows the session to stop without blocking.

!!! tip "For plugin authors"
    If your Claude Code plugin includes Stop hooks, add an early exit for Untether sessions:

    ```bash
    # Skip blocking in Untether sessions — Stop hook blocks displace
    # user-requested content in the Telegram final message.
    [ -n "${UNTETHER_SESSION:-}" ] && echo '{}' && exit 0
    ```

    This is not a security bypass — it simply prevents your hook from interfering with Telegram's single-message output model. See the [interference audit](../audits/pitchdocs-context-guard-interference.md) for a detailed case study.
