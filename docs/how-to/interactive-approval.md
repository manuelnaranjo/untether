# Interactive approval

When Claude Code runs in permission mode, Untether shows inline buttons in Telegram so you can approve or deny tool calls from your phone.

## When buttons appear

What raises a button depends on the permission mode:

- **Plan mode** (`plan`) — when Claude Code wants to **exit plan mode** (ExitPlanMode) or **ask you a question** (AskUserQuestion). Every other tool request that reaches Untether is auto-approved by Untether.
- **`plan-auto`** — only questions. Untether approves the plan itself.
- **`auto`, `bypassPermissions`** — only questions; there is no plan step.
- **`dontAsk`** — nothing: only pre-approved tools run, and anything that would ask (questions included) is denied.
- **Accept edits** (`/planmode off`) and `default` / `manual` — any action the mode doesn't cover asks for approval, whatever the tool ([#749](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/749)).

With **Diff preview** turned on in `/config`, Edit, Write and Bash requests in the autonomous modes also wait for a tap so you see the change first (except during the reply that follows a plan you approved).

## The approval buttons

When a permission request arrives, you see a message with the tool name and a compact diff preview, plus buttons:

| Button | What it does |
|--------|-------------|
| **✅ Approve** | Let Claude Code proceed with the action (reads **✅ Approve Plan** on an ExitPlanMode request) |
| **❌ Deny** | Block the action and ask Claude Code to explain what it was about to do |
| **📋 Pause & Outline Plan** | Stop Claude Code and require a written plan before continuing (only appears for ExitPlanMode) |
| **💬 Let's discuss** | Talk about the plan before approving or denying (only appears after outline is written) |

Buttons clear immediately when you tap them — no waiting for a spinner.

    ```

<div class="tg-buttons">
<span class="tg-btn">✅ Approve</span>
<span class="tg-btn">❌ Deny</span>
</div>

</div>

## Diff previews

For tools that modify files, the approval message includes a compact diff, shown as a `diff` code block, so you can see what's about to change before deciding:

- **Edit**: 📝 file path, removed lines (`- old`) and added lines (`+ new`), up to 4 lines each
- **Write**: 📝 file path, then the first 8 lines of content to be written (as `+` lines)
- **Bash**: `$ command` (up to 200 characters)

Long lines are cut at 60 characters, and a `…(N more added)` line says how much was left out. Before v0.35.5 the preview was rendered as Markdown, so an added `+ x` line could show up as a `- x` bullet; it is now a fenced block that keeps every line as written ([#855](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/855)).

This lets you make informed approve/deny decisions without leaving Telegram.

You can toggle diff previews on or off via `/config` → **Diff preview**. Approval messages include the diff unless you switch it off; when switched off they show the tool name and buttons only — no inline diffs. Switching it on also makes Edit, Write and Bash wait for a tap in the autonomous modes. Useful on slow connections or when you trust the agent enough to skim by tool name alone.

!!! note "After plan approval"
    When you approve a plan outline (see [Plan mode](plan-mode.md#auto-approval-after-plan-approval)), diff previews are skipped for the rest of that reply — tools are auto-approved since you already reviewed the plan. Your next message gets diff previews again.

## Answering questions

When Claude Code calls `AskUserQuestion`, Untether renders the question with interactive option buttons in Telegram:

- **Option buttons** — one per row, up to four. Tap any option to answer instantly. Claude Code receives your choice and continues.
- **"Other (type reply)"** — tap this to type a custom answer. Send your reply as a regular message and Untether routes it back to Claude Code.
- **Multi-question flows** — if Claude Code asks multiple questions, they appear one at a time (e.g. "1 of 3"). Answer each to step through the sequence.

Toggle ask mode on or off via `/config` → Ask mode. When off, questions are auto-denied and Claude Code proceeds with defaults.

</div>

## Tapping a button twice, or too late

Each request can be answered once. A second tap (yours or someone else's in a group) doesn't send anything to Claude Code; you get a popup instead ([#685](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/685), [#684](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/684)):

- **Already answered** — plus a silent `ℹ️ Already answered — approved` (or `denied`, …) line saying what the first tap did
- **No longer needed** — Claude Code withdrew the request, for example because the turn ended; its buttons are removed
- **This request has expired** — the request timed out, or Untether no longer knows about it (for example after a restart)

An unanswered request is denied automatically after 5 minutes (`⏱️ Timed out: auto-denied after 5 min`). Untether checks for this when another approval request arrives, so a single request on its own waits for you.

## Push notifications

When approval buttons appear, Untether sends a separate notification message so you don't miss it — even if your phone is locked or you're in another app.

## Ephemeral cleanup

Approval-related messages (notifications, button messages) are automatically deleted when the run finishes, keeping your chat clean.

## Auto-approve configuration

Which tools need approval depends on the permission mode. In plan mode only `ExitPlanMode` and `AskUserQuestion` reach you (in plan-auto and auto, only `AskUserQuestion`); every other request that reaches Untether is auto-approved by Untether, unless Diff preview is on. In Accept edits (and `default`/`manual` set in `untether.toml`), every tool Claude Code would prompt for becomes an Approve / Deny message. Allow rules in your Claude Code settings, or `[engines.claude] allowed_tools`, pre-approve tools in any mode.

To change this behaviour, adjust the permission mode. See [Plan mode](plan-mode.md) for details.

## Engine-specific approval policies

Claude Code is the only engine with interactive mid-run approval buttons. Other engines offer pre-run policies that control what the agent is allowed to do before it starts:

### Codex CLI — Approval policy

Toggle via `/config` → **Approval policy**:

| Policy | CLI flag | Behaviour |
|--------|----------|-----------|
| **Full auto** (default) | (none) | Codex uses your own Codex sandbox setting (`sandbox_mode` in `~/.codex/config.toml`, or the project's trust level). For a trusted project that is usually `workspace-write`, so Codex can edit files there |
| **Safe** | `codex exec --sandbox read-only` | Reads and read-only commands only. Edits and writes fail and are reported back to the model; shell network access is blocked |

This is a pre-run policy — Codex doesn't pause mid-run to ask for permission. `codex exec` never asks for approval, so the policy picks Codex's sandbox before the run starts.

!!! warning "Safe blocks every sandboxed write"
    The read-only sandbox blocks **all** filesystem writes from Codex's commands, not just edits inside the project: caches (`.pytest_cache`, `__pycache__`, `npm`/`uv` caches), build output and `/tmp` too. Tests, builds and package installs fail in Safe. Switch the chat to **Full auto** when you want Codex to run them. MCP tools run outside Codex's command sandbox, so Safe does not restrict what an MCP server does.

!!! note "Before v0.35.5"
    Safe used to pass `--ask-for-approval untrusted`. `codex exec` never applied that flag, so Safe ran exactly like Full auto, and codex-cli 0.149.0+ rejects it outright, so every Safe run failed at startup ([#830](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/830)).

### Antigravity CLI — Approval mode

Toggle via `/config` → **Approval mode**:

| Mode | CLI flag | Behaviour |
|------|----------|-----------|
| **Read-only** (default) | (none) | Permissions enforced per settings |
| **Edit files** | `--mode accept-edits` | File changes accepted |
| **Full access** | `--dangerously-skip-permissions` | All tools auto-approved — full autonomy |

This is also a pre-run policy. Antigravity CLI doesn't have interactive mid-run approval in headless mode.

Both policies persist per chat via `/config` and can be cleared back to the default. See [Inline settings](inline-settings.md) for the full `/config` menu reference.
