# Cost budgets

Running agents remotely means they can rack up costs while you're not watching. Untether tracks API costs per run and per day, with configurable budget limits, warning thresholds, and auto-cancel to keep spending under control — even when you're away from the screen.

## Configure budgets

=== "untether config"

    ```sh
    untether config set cost_budget.enabled true
    untether config set cost_budget.max_cost_per_run 2.00
    untether config set cost_budget.max_cost_per_day 10.00
    ```

=== "toml"

    ```toml
    [cost_budget]
    enabled = true
    max_cost_per_run = 2.00
    max_cost_per_day = 10.00
    ```

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `enabled` | `false` | Enable cost tracking and budget enforcement |
| `max_cost_per_run` | (none) | Maximum cost for a single run (USD) |
| `max_cost_per_day` | (none) | Maximum total cost per day (USD) |
| `warn_at_pct` | `70` | Show a warning when this percentage of the budget is reached |
| `auto_cancel` | `false` | Automatically cancel the run when a budget is exceeded |

## Per-chat overrides

You can toggle budgets on or off per chat without editing the config file. Open `/config` → **Cost & Usage** and use the toggle buttons:

- **Budget enabled** — turn budget tracking on or off for this chat
- **Budget auto-cancel** — enable or disable automatic run cancellation when a budget is exceeded

These override the global `[cost_budget]` settings for the specific chat. Clear the override to revert to the global setting. See [Inline settings](inline-settings.md) for the full `/config` menu reference.

!!! warning "Loop mode and budgets"
    If you turn on Loop mode in `/config → 🔁 Loop mode`, autonomous loop fires count toward the same daily and per-run budget caps as manual runs. There is no separate per-loop budget — the existing `max_cost_per_day` cap auto-cancels any loop iteration that would exceed it. **Set a budget before turning on Loop mode** to bound your exposure. See [Schedule tasks → Loop mode](schedule-tasks.md#loop-mode) for the full picture. ([#289](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/289))

## How it works

After each run completes, Untether checks the reported cost against your budgets:

1. **Per-run check**: if the run cost exceeds `max_cost_per_run`, you get an alert
2. **Daily check**: if the cumulative daily cost exceeds `max_cost_per_day`, you get an alert
3. **Warning threshold**: at `warn_at_pct` (default 70%) of either budget, you get an early warning

!!! note "Token-only engines"
    Engines that don't report USD costs (Codex, Pi, and OpenCode on its free tier) show token counts in the footer instead (e.g. `💰 26.0k in / 71 out`). Antigravity CLI and AMP surface `total_cost_usd` when their CLI reports one; on the free tier they render tokens only. Budget alerts apply only to the USD-reporting path.

### Alert levels

| Alert | Icon | Meaning |
|-------|------|---------|
| Warning | `???` | Cost is approaching the budget threshold |
| Exceeded | `????` | Cost has exceeded the budget |

When `auto_cancel = true` and a budget is exceeded, Untether cancels the run automatically. Otherwise, you see the alert but the run continues.

### Daily reset

The daily cost counter resets at midnight (local time, based on the server clock). Each new day starts from zero.

## Check current usage

Use the `/usage` command in Telegram to see your Claude Code subscription usage:

```
/usage
```

This shows:

- **5h window**: usage percentage and time until reset
- **Weekly**: 7-day usage percentage and time until reset
- **Per-model breakdown**: Sonnet and Opus usage (if applicable)
- **Extra credits**: any overage credits used

The `/usage` command reads your Claude Code OAuth credentials to fetch live data from the Anthropic API. If you see "No Claude credentials found", run `claude login` in your terminal.

!!! untether "Untether"
    **Claude Code usage**

    **5h window**: 42% used (2h 6m left)<br>
    **Weekly**: 28% used (5d 2h left)

    sonnet: 38% · opus: 4%<br>
    extra credits: $0.00

## Subscription usage footer

Untether can show subscription usage in the footer of completed messages. This is configured in the `[footer]` section:

=== "toml"

    ```toml
    [footer]
    show_usage = true
    ```

When enabled, completed messages show a line like:

```
5h: 45% (2h 15m) | 7d: 30% (4d 3h)
```

This tells you how much of your 5-hour and 7-day rate limits you've used, and when they reset.

## Historical statistics

For historical run data beyond the current session, use the `/stats` command:

```
/stats
```

This shows per-engine session statistics (runs, actions, duration) across today, this week, and all time. Pass an engine name to filter (e.g. `/stats claude`). Data is persisted in the config directory and auto-pruned after 90 days.
