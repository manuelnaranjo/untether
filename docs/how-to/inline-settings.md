# Inline settings menu

Adjust Untether's behaviour without editing config files or restarting — tap buttons right in Telegram. The `/config` command opens an interactive settings menu with inline keyboard buttons, similar to BotFather's settings style. Navigate sub-pages, toggle settings, and return to the overview, all within a single message that edits in place.

## Open the menu

Send `/config` in any chat:

```
/config
```

The home page shows current values grouped under **Agent controls**, **Display** and **Routing**, with buttons arranged in pairs (max 2 per row) for comfortable mobile tap targets:

```

<!-- TODO: capture screenshot: config-menu-v035 — /config home page with 2-column toggle layout -->

!!! note "Engine-specific controls"
    The home page adapts to the current engine. **Claude Code** shows Permission mode, Ask mode, and Diff preview under "Agent controls". **Codex CLI** shows **Approval policy** (full auto / safe = read-only sandbox). **Antigravity CLI** shows **Approval mode** (read-only / edit files / full access). Engines without interactive controls (OpenCode, Pi, Amp) skip the agent controls section entirely.

## Navigate sub-pages

Tap any button to open that setting's page. Each sub-page shows:

- A description of the setting
- The current effective value (resolved from override or default — never shows a bare "default" label)
- Buttons to change the value
- A **Clear override** button to revert to the global/engine default
- A **← Back** button to return to the home page
- A **📖 Learn more** link to the matching page of the help centre (`littlebearapps.com/help/untether/…`)

## Toggle behaviour

Most settings use a **two-button selection** pattern: `[On] [Off] [Clear]` with a ✓ on the active option. Tap either button to set the value. Tapping **Clear** removes the per-chat override and falls back to the global setting.

When you tap a setting button:

1. **Confirmation toast** — a brief popup appears confirming the change (e.g. "Permission mode: off (acceptEdits)", "Verbose: on"). This uses the same toast mechanism as Claude Code approval buttons.
2. **Auto-return** — the menu automatically navigates back to the home page, showing the updated value across all settings. No need to tap "Back" manually.

### Multi-state settings

Some settings have more than two states and use a different layout:

- **Permission mode** (Claude Code) — four options shown in a 2+2+1 split: `[Off] [On]` on the first row, `[Plan-auto] [Auto]` on the second, `[Clear override]` on the third
- **Approval mode** (Antigravity) — three options (read-only / edit files / full access)
- **Effort** (Claude Code) — low / medium / high / xhigh / max
- **Reasoning** (Codex) — low / medium / high / xhigh
- **Effort** (Antigravity) — low / medium / high

The active option is marked with a ✓ prefix. Tap a different option to switch.

### Engine-aware visibility

Settings are engine-specific and only appear when relevant:

- **Permission mode** — Claude Code only. Codex and Antigravity have their own pre-run policies instead.
- **Approval policy** — Codex CLI only. Toggle between "full auto" (default, Codex's own sandbox setting) and "safe" (read-only sandbox via `--sandbox read-only`; tests, builds and cache/`/tmp` writes fail too). This is a pre-run policy — not interactive mid-run approval.
- **Approval mode** — Antigravity CLI only. Toggle between "read-only", "edit files" (`accept-edits`), and "full access" (`auto`). This is a pre-run policy.
- **Ask mode** and **Diff preview** — Claude Code only. Hidden for other engines.
- **Follow-up** — Claude Code only ([#775](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/775)). `queue` (default) or `steer` for messages sent while a run is working; see [steer follow-ups](steer-follow-ups.md). Hidden on the home page for other engines; if you reach the page anyway it says that other engines always queue.
- **Reasoning / Effort** — Claude Code, Codex, and Antigravity. Hidden for OpenCode, Pi, and Amp.
- **Engine & model** — always visible. Engine and model are merged into a single page. Shows the current engine and model override; to set a model, use `/model set <name>`.

When you switch engines via the Engine & model page, the home page automatically shows or hides the relevant controls.

## Available settings

| Setting | Options | Persisted |
|---------|---------|-----------|
| Permission mode | off, on, plan-auto, auto | Yes (chat prefs) |
| Approval policy | full auto, safe (read-only sandbox) | Yes (chat prefs) |
| Approval mode | read-only, edit files, full access | Yes (chat prefs) |
| Ask mode | off, on | Yes (chat prefs) |
| Verbose | off, on | No (in memory, cleared on restart) |
| Diff preview | off, on | Yes (chat prefs) |
| Engine & model | any configured engine + model | Yes (chat prefs) |
| Effort / Reasoning | Claude: low, medium, high, xhigh, max; Codex: low, medium, high, xhigh; Antigravity: low, medium, high | Yes (chat prefs) |
| Cost & usage | API cost, subscription usage, budget, stop at limit | Yes (chat prefs) |
| Resume line | off, on | Yes (chat prefs) |
| Listen | all, mentions | Yes (chat prefs) |
| Follow-up | queue, steer | Yes (chat prefs) |
| Budget | off, on | Yes (chat prefs) |
| Stop at limit | off, on | Yes (chat prefs) |

Approval policy appears instead of Permission mode when the engine is Codex CLI. Approval mode appears instead of Permission mode when the engine is Antigravity CLI.

### Triggers page {#triggers-page}

When `[triggers]` is enabled, the home page gains a bottom row with a `⏰ Triggers` button that opens the Triggers page (`config:tg`), even when nothing is configured yet (the page then explains how to add one). When at least one cron or webhook is configured, the same row also carries the one-tap **⏸ Pause triggers** / **▶️ Resume triggers** toggle ([#296](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/296)) ([#271](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/271) Tier 2 + [#294](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/294)).

The Triggers page shows:

* **State and counts** — `running` / `paused`, plus per-chat cron and webhook totals.
* **Master pause/resume toggle** — tap **Pause** to suspend all cron firing and webhook dispatch globally without editing config; tap **Resume** to clear it. While paused, webhooks return `503 triggers paused` (with `Retry-After: 60`), the webhook server's HTTP `/health` endpoint reports `paused: true`, and `/ping` shows `⏸ triggers paused: … (suspended)`. Pause is in-memory only — restart auto-resumes (the safe default).
* **Per-chat cron list** — each line shows the cron `id`, human-readable schedule via `describe_cron(schedule, timezone)`, project, engine, the cron's own `model=` / `effort=` when it sets one ([#743](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/743)), and last-fired relative time.
* **Per-chat webhook list** — each line shows the webhook `id`, path, auth scheme, project, engine, and last-fired.

Lists are scoped to the current chat (`crons_for_chat()` / `webhooks_for_chat()` with the bridge `default_chat_id` fallback), capped at 10 entries with a `…and N more (see untether.toml)` overflow marker. The pause/resume controls remain visible even when the chat has no triggers configured. `📡` is Listen only; Triggers always use `⏰`, matching `/ping` and the run footer.

See [Schedule tasks](schedule-tasks.md#pausing-all-triggers) for the pause flow end-to-end.

### Loop mode page {#loop-mode}

When the active engine is Claude Code, the home page gains a `🔁 Loop mode` button that opens the Loop sub-page ([#289](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/289)). Loop mode is **off by default** — turning it on enables Untether's observation of Claude's session-scoped scheduling tools (`CronCreate`, `ScheduleWakeup`) so iterations keep firing after the subprocess exits.

The page shows:

* **State** — `Currently: On (global)` / `Off (global)` (no per-chat override, so the `[loop] enabled` default applies) or `On (per-chat)` / `Off (per-chat)`.
* **Cost + quota warning** — explicit reminder before turning ON: every loop fire counts against `[cost_budget]`, so set a budget first.
* **💰 Set a budget** — deep-link to the `Cost & Usage` page (`config:cu`) for one-tap budget setup.
* **Buttons** — `[On] [Off]` with ✓ on the active per-chat choice, then `[Clear override] [💰 Set a budget]` and `[← Back]`.

`/cancel` and `/new` both drop pending loop iterations for the current chat (or forum topic) and write a do-not-resume sentinel so a subsequent `loop_scheduler` resume can't replay them. `/continue` is unaffected (it doesn't trigger loop replay).

Loop mode is **Claude-only** (`LOOP_SUPPORTED_ENGINES = frozenset({"claude"})`); the button is hidden for other engines. See [Schedule tasks → Loop mode](schedule-tasks.md#loop-mode) for the full architecture and cost guidance.

### Cost & Usage page

The Cost & Usage sub-page merges cost display and budget controls into a unified page with toggle rows:

- **API cost** — per-run cost in the message footer (requires engine cost reporting)
- **Subscription usage** — 5h/weekly subscription usage in the footer (Claude Code only)
- **Budget** — turn budget tracking on or off for this chat (overrides global `[cost_budget]` setting)
- **Stop at limit** — per-chat override of `[cost_budget] auto_cancel`. Stops new runs once the daily budget is reached and ends a session after the reply that passes the per-run budget. It can't interrupt a reply in progress (see [Cost budgets](cost-budgets.md#stop-at-limit))

Each toggle uses the `[✓ Label: on] [Label: off] [Clear]` compact pattern (labels distinguish the four toggles). Clear removes the per-chat override and falls back to the global config.

For historical cost data across sessions, use the [`/stats`](../reference/commands-and-directives.md) command.

## Callbacks vs commands

- **Text command** (`/config`): sends a new message with the menu.
- **Button tap**: edits the existing message in place — no message spam.

All button interactions use early callback answering for instant feedback.
