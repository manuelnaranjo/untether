# Session statistics

See how much work your agents have done while you've been away. The `/stats` command shows per-engine session statistics — run counts, action totals, and duration — across today, this week, and all time.

## View statistics

Send `/stats` in any chat:

```
/stats
```

Example output:

```
Session Stats — Today

claude: 5 runs, 42 actions, 12m 30s, last 2h ago
codex: 3 runs, 18 actions, 4m 15s, last 45m ago

Total: 8 runs, 60 actions, 16m 45s
```

## Filter by engine

Pass an engine name to see stats for just that engine:

```
/stats claude
```

## Change the time period

Specify a period after the engine name (or on its own):

```
/stats today         # today only (default)
/stats week          # this week
/stats all           # all time (up to 90 days)
/stats claude week   # claude, this week
```

## Check auth status

Use `/stats auth` to see authentication status for all installed engines:

```
/stats auth
```

Example output:

```
Auth Status

claude: logged in (oauth)
codex: logged in using chatgpt
opencode: 2 provider(s)
pi: 1 provider(s)
```

This checks each engine's credential files or auth status commands without starting a run.

## How data is collected

Untether automatically records statistics after each run completes:

- **Run count** — incremented for every completed run
- **Action count** — total tool calls / actions across all runs
- **Duration** — cumulative engine execution time (in milliseconds)
- **Last run timestamp** — when the engine last completed a run

Data is stored in `stats.json` in the Untether config directory (`~/.untether/` by default). Records older than 90 days are automatically pruned on startup.

## Background-task telemetry

v0.35.2 adds per-session tracking for Claude Code's long-running primitives. Counts and outstanding deadlines are recorded for: `Monitor`, `Bash` (`run_in_background`), `Agent` (`run_in_background`), `ScheduleWakeup`, and `RemoteTrigger`. These feed into `/health` and the stall detector so background work isn't mistaken for a wedged session. ([#347](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/347))

## Cost footer accuracy

Run and session cost footers were tightened in v0.35.2. Claude usage queries use a 60 s TTL cache (stale-while-error), Antigravity pulls from result metadata, and AMP now reports `total_cost_usd`. Zero-turn sessions render `$0.00` instead of a blank. ([#316](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/316))
