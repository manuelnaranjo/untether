# Update Untether

Untether publishes releases to [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/untether/). To upgrade to the latest version:

=== "uv (recommended)"

    ```sh
    uv tool upgrade untether
    ```

=== "pipx"

    ```sh
    pipx upgrade untether
    ```

Check your current version:

```sh
untether --version
```

After upgrading, restart the service if running as a systemd unit:

```sh
systemctl --user restart untether
```

!!! note "Agent CLIs are separate"
    Untether wraps agent CLIs (Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, Pi, Antigravity CLI, Amp) as subprocesses. Updating Untether does not update the agent CLIs. Update them separately:

    ```sh
    npm update -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
    npm update -g @openai/codex
    npm update -g opencode-ai
    npm update -g @mariozechner/pi-coding-agent
    npm update -g @sourcegraph/amp
    ```

## Upgrading to v0.35.5

See the [v0.35.5 changelog entry](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v0355-unreleased) for the full list. Behaviour changes that may affect operators:

- **`auto` permission mode renamed `plan-auto` (breaking).** `/planmode auto` now selects Claude Code's own classifier-gated auto mode. Per-chat settings migrate automatically; if `untether.toml` sets `permission_mode = "auto"` and you want the old behaviour, change it to `"plan-auto"`. See [Plan mode](plan-mode.md). ([#741](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/741))
- **`/planmode off` (Accept edits) now asks before shell commands.** Prompting modes (`acceptEdits`, `default`, `manual`) previously approved every tool silently. Anything the mode doesn't cover now shows Approve / Deny buttons unless your Claude Code settings allow it. Crons and webhooks can't wait for a tap — see the next point. ([#749](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/749))
- **Unattended cron and webhook runs deny instead of waiting (breaking, Claude).** A tool approval, plan approval or question in a cron or webhook run is denied at once and listed in the run's final (`🔒 unattended (cron:<id>) · denied Write ×2 — nobody to approve`, logged as `permission.unattended_deny`). Crons in `plan` or a prompting mode, **including crons with no `permission_mode`** (they inherit the chat's `/planmode`, then the engine default `plan`), now end with a plan or a report instead of doing the work. Give every Claude cron that should act on its own an explicit `permission_mode` (`plan-auto`, `auto` or `bypassPermissions`); webhooks follow the chat's `/planmode`. The startup message lists the crons this affects. A reply to an unattended run continues with normal buttons, and `/at` runs still ask. See [Webhooks and cron](webhooks-and-cron.md). ([#835](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/835), [#836](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/836))
- **`/new` and `/cancel` in a forum topic only touch that topic.** `/new` in General no longer cancels every topic's runs, and a no-reply `/cancel` in one topic can't stop another topic's run. Cron and webhook runs belong to General. See [Topics](topics.md#reset-a-topic-session). ([#826](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/826))
- **`/export` sends a file.** The transcript arrives as a `.md` or `.json` document instead of an inline message cut at 3,000 characters. See [Export sessions](export-sessions.md). ([#418](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/418))
- **Claude sessions stay open after the answer while background work runs.** Background-task, Monitor and scheduled-wake-up turns arrive as their own messages, and follow-ups go into the same session instead of a fresh one. Set `[watchdog] live_sessions = false` to restore the old behaviour. See [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md#messages-arrive-after-the-run-finished). ([#776](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/776))
- **Claude per-run costs are now per run.** A resumed session's earlier spend no longer counts against each run's budget or `/stats`, so per-run and daily figures may drop. ([#778](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/778))
- **Claude rate-limit and stall signals are quieter and more accurate.** Routine `rate_limit_event` usage snapshots no longer show a fake `⏳ Rate limited` wait; only a real rejection latches until its reset time, and a `⚠️ 5h limit N% used` heads-up appears at most once per window. API retry back-offs show as `🔁 API error … retrying in Ns`. Live-session idle holds no longer raise stall warnings, and `session.summary` reports them as `peak_live_idle_seconds`, so `peak_idle_seconds` drops on live sessions — adjust any log alerts that key on it. ([#790](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/790), [#792](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/792), [#787](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/787))
- **`extra_args` refuses approval and sandbox bypass flags (breaking, security).** A `[engines.claude]` or `[engines.codex]` `extra_args` that carries `--dangerously-skip-permissions`, `--allowedTools`, `--yolo`, `--sandbox danger-full-access`, `-C`/`--cd` and similar now fails to load: the default engine won't start, and any other engine is disabled until you remove the flag (the error names it). Use the named keys instead (`allowed_tools`, `permission_mode`). See [Security → Engine CLI flags](security.md#engine-cli-flags-extra_args). ([#209](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/209))
- **Codex safe mode now actually restricts Codex (behaviour change, security).** Before v0.35.5 the Codex **safe** approval policy did not restrict anything — `codex exec` ignored the flag — and on codex-cli 0.149.0+ every safe-mode run failed at startup. Safe now uses Codex's read-only sandbox: file edits, writes, tests, builds, package installs and shell network access are blocked, including cache and `/tmp` writes. If you want Codex to edit files or run tests, switch the chat to **Full auto** in `/config` → Approval policy. ([#830](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/830))
- **A plan approval now covers one reply (Claude).** Approving a plan used to skip per-tool approvals for every later message and background wake-up in the same open session, for up to four hours. It now ends with the reply it was given in, and plan mode switches back on when that reply ends. Set `[watchdog] rearm_plan_mode = false` to go back to an approval lasting until the session closes. See [Plan mode](plan-mode.md#auto-approval-after-plan-approval). ([#383](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/383))
- **File deny globs match at the project root (security).** The default `deny_globs` now also cover a root-level `key.pem`, `id_rsa`, `.npmrc`, `.netrc` or `.ssh/config`, and a project-root `.env.example` now matches `**/.env.*`, so `/file get` and outbox delivery skip it. Deny globs are also checked after following symlinks. See [Security → File transfer deny globs](security.md#file-transfer-deny-globs). ([#831](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/831), [#390](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/390))
- **`/browse` needs a project.** It no longer falls back to the process working directory (your home directory under systemd). Bind the chat to a project or set `default_project`. Hidden paths and deny globs are now refused there too. See [Browse files](browse-files.md). ([#389](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/389))
- **Crons and webhooks with a `project` but no `engine` use that project's engine.** They used to run on the global default engine. Set `engine` on the trigger if you relied on the old behaviour. ([#862](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/862))
- **Codex no longer offers the `minimal` reasoning level.** A saved `minimal` is ignored with a one-line note and the run uses Codex's default. ([#416](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/416))
- **Voice transcription has a default vocabulary hint.** Unless you set `voice_transcription_prompt`, Untether now biases transcription towards engine and project names such as Claude, `CLAUDE.md` and Codex. Set it to `""` to send no hint. See [Voice notes](voice-notes.md#improve-recognition-of-names). ([#703](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/703), [#789](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/789))
- **Gemini CLI and Amp are deprecated**, targeted for removal in 0.36.0.

New in v0.35.5 and worth a look after upgrading: [steering a running Claude run](steer-follow-ups.md) with `/steer`, the [background-task status message and context-window percentage](verbose-progress.md) in Claude runs, approval [diff previews](interactive-approval.md#diff-previews) as a proper diff block, and a [per-cron model and effort](schedule-tasks.md#pick-a-model-per-cron) (`model` / `reasoning` on `[[triggers.crons]]`, [#743](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/743)).

## Upgrading to v0.35.4

See the [v0.35.4 changelog entry](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v0354-2026-07-22) for the full list. Behaviour changes that may affect operators:

- **Voice transcription is now SSRF-validated.** If `voice_transcription_base_url` points at a loopback or private-network endpoint (e.g. a local Whisper server at `http://localhost:8000/v1`), transcription is now **refused** unless you allowlist it — add `voice_transcription_url_allowlist = ["127.0.0.0/8"]` to `[transports.telegram]`. The default public path (`api.openai.com`) is unaffected. ([#381](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/381))
- **Webhooks with `auth = "none"` are refused on non-loopback hosts.** An unauthenticated webhook bound to a public interface is now dropped at startup and on hot-reload (polling, commands, and crons keep running); loopback binds are still allowed. To keep an unauthenticated webhook on a public host, set `[triggers] allow_unauthenticated_webhooks = true`. ([#382](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/382))
- **The pre-spawn RAM guard is now concurrency-aware.** The block threshold rises with the number of runs already in flight (`prespawn_ram_per_run_reserve_mb`, default 750), and an optional hard ceiling (`max_concurrent_engine_runs`, default `0` = unlimited) caps concurrent engine subprocesses. On small VPS hosts this stops the OOM killer SIGKILLing a live session — see the sizing note under [config → watchdog](../reference/config.md#watchdog). ([#589](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/589))
- **Empty-resume recovery (Claude).** A resume that returns an empty 0-turn result now auto-recovers on a fresh session instead of silently doing nothing, and post-result force-killed sessions are quarantined proactively. No config needed; opt out via `[auto_continue] empty_resume_fresh = false`. ([#631](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/631), [#632](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/632))
- **The Claude plan-mode progressive cooldown was retired.** The upstream `ExitPlanMode` re-issue loop it worked around is fixed (CLI 2.1.215); "Pause & Outline Plan" now holds the session open on a text-based outline gate. No action needed. ([#570](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/570))

## Upgrading to v0.35.3

See the [v0.35.3 changelog entry](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v0353-2026-05-20) for the full list. Behaviour changes that may affect operators upgrading from v0.35.2 or earlier:

- **An empty `allowed_user_ids` stops startup (breaking, security).** Untether refuses to start with `ConfigError: [transports.telegram] allowed_user_ids is empty …`. Add your Telegram user ID (see [Security → Restrict access](security.md#restrict-access)), or set `allow_any_user = true` if you really want an open bot. ([#377](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/377))
- **`/trigger` is now `/listen`.** The old name still works as a deprecated alias. ([#297](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/297))

## Upgrading to v0.35.2

See the [v0.35.2 changelog entry](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v0352-2026-04-20) for the full change list. Behaviour changes that may affect operators upgrading from v0.35.1 or earlier:

- **Claude/Pi subprocess env is now allowlisted.** Arbitrary process env no longer leaks to agent CLIs. If a plugin or MCP server depends on a specific variable, confirm it's on the allowlist — see [Env allowlist (Claude/Pi)](../reference/env-vars.md#env-allowlist-claudepi). ([#198](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/198), [#361](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/361))
- **`CLAUDE_STREAM_IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS` default raised to `300000` (5 min).** The old 60 s default killed long-thinking runs. Set the var explicitly to restore the old value. ([#342](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/342))
- **`[security] env_audit = true` by default.** Any leaked env var logs `claude.env_audit.leaked_var` WARNING and subprocesses spawn under `env -i`. Set to `false` in `untether.toml` to restore legacy behaviour. ([#361](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/361))
- **`run_once` crons persist fired state** to `run_once_fired.json` (sibling to `untether.toml`). They no longer re-fire on reload or restart. Delete the file to re-arm. ([#317](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/317))
- **Webhook port bind failure no longer crashes the bot.** Check logs for `triggers.server.bind_failed`. Remediation: `ss -tlnp | grep <port>` to find the conflicting process, then set `port = <N>` in `[triggers]`. ([#320](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/320))
- **Engine subprocess cleanup walks the process tree.** Orphaned `workerd` processes (seen at 37 GB RSS in pre-0.35.2 incidents) are now signalled alongside the parent. ([#275](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/275))
