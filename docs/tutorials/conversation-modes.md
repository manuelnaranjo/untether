# Conversation modes

Untether can handle follow-up messages in two ways: **chat mode** (auto-resume) or **stateless** (reply-to-continue). Both work across all your devices — start a conversation on your phone, continue it from your laptop, or check in from [Telegram Web](https://web.telegram.org).

During [onboarding](install.md), you chose a **workflow** (assistant, workspace, or handoff) that automatically configured this for you:

| Workflow | Session mode | Topics | Resume lines |
|----------|--------------|--------|--------------|
| **assistant** | chat | off | hidden |
| **workspace** | chat | on | hidden |
| **handoff** | stateless | off | shown |

This page explains what those settings mean and how to change them.

## Chat mode (auto-resume)

**What it feels like:** a normal chat assistant.

!!! user "You"
    explain what this repo does

!!! untether "Untether"
    done · codex · 8s
    ...

!!! user "You"
    now add tests

Untether treats the second message as a continuation. If you want a clean slate, use:

!!! user "You"
    /new

To pin a project or branch for the chat, use:

!!! user "You"
    /ctx set <project> [@branch]

`/new` cancels any running task and clears the session, but keeps the bound context.

Tip: set a default engine for this chat with `/agent set claude`.

## Stateless (reply-to-continue)

**What it feels like:** every message is independent until you reply.

!!! user "You"
    explain what this repo does

!!! untether "Untether"
    done · codex · 8s
    ...
    `codex resume abc123`

To continue the same session, **reply** to a message with a resume line:

!!! untether "Untether"
    done · codex · 8s

    !!! user "You"
        now add tests

## Changing your settings

You can manually change these settings in your config file:

=== "untether config"

    ```sh
    untether config set transports.telegram.session_mode "chat"
    untether config set transports.telegram.show_resume_line false
    ```

=== "toml"

    ```toml
    [transports.telegram]
    session_mode = "chat"      # "chat" or "stateless"
    show_resume_line = false   # true or false
    ```

Or re-run onboarding to pick a different workflow:

```sh
untether --onboard
```

## Resume lines in chat mode

If you enable chat mode (or topics), Untether can auto-resume, so you can hide resume lines for a cleaner chat.
Disable them if you want a fully clean footer, or enable `show_resume_line` to keep reply-branching visible.

If you prefer always-visible resume lines, set:

=== "untether config"

    ```sh
    untether config set transports.telegram.show_resume_line true
    ```

=== "toml"

    ```toml
    [transports.telegram]
    show_resume_line = true
    ```

## Reply-to-continue still works

Even in chat mode, replying to a message with a resume line takes precedence and branches from that point.

## Cross-environment resume

Started a session in your terminal and left the house? Use `/continue` to pick it up from Telegram — no reply needed. Works with Claude, Codex, OpenCode, Pi, and Antigravity.

See the [cross-environment resume guide](../how-to/cross-environment-resume.md) for details.
