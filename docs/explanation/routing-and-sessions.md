# Routing & sessions

Untether supports both **stateless** and **chat** modes for session handling. In stateless mode, each message starts a new session unless you reply to continue. In chat mode, new messages auto-resume the previous session.

## Continuation (how threads persist)

Untether supports four ways to continue a thread:

1. **Reply-to-continue** (always available)
   - Reply to any bot message that contains a resume line in the footer.
   - Untether extracts the resume token and resumes that engine thread.
   - Reply resume lines always take precedence over chat sessions or topic storage.
   - The resumed run updates the stored session for that engine when the token is known.
2. **Forum topics** (optional)
   - Topics can store resume tokens per topic and auto-resume new messages in that topic.
   - Topic state is stored in `telegram_topics_state.json`.
   - Reset with `/new`.
3. **Chat sessions** (optional)
   - Set `session_mode = "chat"` to store one resume token per chat (per sender in groups).
   - Stored sessions are per engine; resuming a different engine does not overwrite others.
   - State is stored in `telegram_chat_sessions_state.json`.
   - Reset with `/new`.
4. **Cross-environment resume** (`/continue`)
   - Resume the most recent session in the project directory, regardless of where it was started.
   - Useful for picking up a CLI session (iTerm, tmux, mosh) from Telegram while away from the terminal.
   - Uses each engine's native "continue" flag (`--continue`, `resume --last`, `--resume latest`).
   - Works with Claude, Codex, OpenCode, Pi, and Antigravity. Not supported for AMP. See the [cross-environment resume guide](../how-to/cross-environment-resume.md).

Reply-to-continue works even if topics or chat sessions are enabled.

## Listen mode (pre-routing filter)

Before routing, Untether checks the chat's **listen mode** (renamed from "trigger mode" in v0.35.3 — [#297](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/297)). In `mentions` mode, messages that don't @mention the bot, reply to the bot, or start with a known slash command are silently dropped — they never reach the router. In the default `all` mode, every message passes through.

Listen mode is configured per chat via `/listen` (or the deprecated `/trigger` alias) or `/config`, with optional per-topic overrides in forum groups. See [Group chat](../how-to/group-chat.md#set-trigger-mode-for-groups) for details.

## Routing (how Untether picks a runner)

For each message, Untether:

- parses directive prefixes (`/<engine-id>`, `/<project-alias>`, `@branch`) from the first non-empty line
- attempts to extract a resume token by polling available runners
- if a resume token is found, routes to the matching runner; otherwise uses the configured default engine

## Serialization (why you don’t get overlapping runs)

Untether allows parallel runs across **different threads**, but enforces serialization within a thread:

- Telegram side: jobs are queued FIFO per thread.
- Runner side: runners enforce per-resume-token locks (so the same session can’t be resumed concurrently).

The precise invariants are specified in the [Specification](../reference/specification.md).
