    #568 — this is deliberately a **symptom-based** predicate, not an
    issue-identity one. It mitigates two upstream defects at once:
    claude-code#34142 (assistant continuation skipped after tool_result;
    CLOSED/COMPLETED upstream) and claude-code#30333 (ResultMessage never
    emitted with background subagents; CLOSED/NOT_PLANNED — permanent).
    The retirement audit asked to drop the #34142 half and keep the #30333
    half, but at this decision point the subprocess has already exited and
    the two are observationally identical: a `result` frame would exclude
    the predicate entirely rather than discriminate, and `background_observed`
    correlates with #30333 without being sound (it also fires for Monitor,
    background Bash, ScheduleWakeup and RemoteTrigger). Gating on it would
    silently drop recovery for a defect upstream has declined to fix, so the
    mitigation is KEPT and the relevant fields are logged on
    `session.auto_continue` instead, to build the evidence a future
    narrowing would need. Do not re-introduce issue-number branching here
    without a discriminator with measured false-positive/negative rates.

    #640 — requires a clean `rc == 0`. Signal deaths (SIGTERM/SIGKILL from
    earlyoom, the OOM killer, or Untether's own post-result limbo teardown)
    and ordinary failures must never be auto-resumed. `None` stays eligible
    only as a fail-open for engines/paths that do not thread a return code;
    for Claude it is now always populated (`runners/claude.py`, run_impl).
    14 days of fleet data showed 47/49 auto-continues at rc=0 and 2 at
    rc=143 — the latter being exactly the leak this gate now closes.

    #716 — the ``a result frame would exclude the predicate entirely``
    claim above was **assumed, never enforced**. It reads
    ``last_event_type``, a running value that records the last frame seen
    rather than whether the run reached its result, and the two come apart:
    106 healthy (``ok=True``, uncancelled) Claude runs on nsd logged
    ``last_event_type=user``, satisfying every gate here. Nothing but the
    caller's ``final_delivery["sent"]`` check stopped a salvage re-spawn of
    a finished run.

    The claim is now enforced by ``saw_result``, a monotonic per-run latch
    set when a ``result`` frame is parsed. That is the sound
    discriminator for this predicate: neither upstream defect emits a
    ``result`` at all (claude-code#34142 skips the assistant continuation
    after a tool_result; #30333 never emits ResultMessage with background
    subagents), so gating on it preserves both mitigations exactly while
    excluding runs that finished.

    Note what this does NOT claim: the trailing-frame mechanism #716
    hypothesised is disproven — a frame after the terminal ``result``
    cannot reach the stream, because the CompletedEvent breaks the read
    loop (see ``JsonlStreamState.saw_result``). A ``user`` value on a
    completed run means the result never landed on that stream object, and
    the reason for that is tracked separately.
