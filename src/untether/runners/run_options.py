# Permission modes the Claude Code CLI accepts for ``--permission-mode``.
#
# Derived from **CLI 2.1.228** (verified on lba-1, 2026-08-12) by reading
# ``claude --help`` and then spawn-probing every value.  Two quirks the help
# text alone would get wrong (#742):
#
#   * ``manual`` is a documented *alias* for ``default`` (CLI v2.1.200+).
#     ``--help`` lists ``manual`` in place of ``default``, but the binary
#     accepts both — a probe of ``--permission-mode default`` exits 0.
#   * an unknown value exits 1 with commander's "Allowed choices are ..."
#     usage error, which ``tests/test_claude_permission_modes.py`` parses to
#     detect drift automatically.
#
# Semantics (docs.claude.com "Choose a permission mode", read 2026-08-12):
#   default / manual  — reads only; everything else prompts
#   acceptEdits       — reads, in-scope file edits, common filesystem commands
#   plan              — research only; edits blocked until the plan is approved
#   auto              — classifier-gated; approves routine work, hard-denies
#                       exfiltration.  Becomes the CLI default for new Pro/Max/
#                       Team sessions on 2026-08-14
#   dontAsk           — auto-denies anything that would prompt; only

def is_claude_prompting_mode(mode: str | None) -> bool:

    Enumerated rather than derived, so adding a CLI mode is a deliberate
    classification rather than an accident of a predicate.  Membership drives
    two things: whether ``--allowedTools`` is sent, and whether the control
    handler gates every tool or only ``ExitPlanMode``/``AskUserQuestion``.

    ``plan`` and ``plan-auto`` are **False** despite plan mode being
    interactive.  Probe G (2026-08-13, CLI 2.1.228) showed plan mode blocks a
    ``Write`` *internally* — the file was never created and no ``can_use_tool``
    ever surfaced — so it does not need Untether's gate to be safe.  Probes H/I
    showed the opposite: dropping the allowlist there turns every ``Read`` into
    a stage-6 round-trip Untether approves anyway.  Gating plan mode would buy
    no safety and cost an approval button per tool in the fleet's most-used
    mode.  See docs/findings/2026-08-13-claude-permission-modes.md.
    **Probe G no longer holds on CLI 2.1.285**: plan mode raises a
    ``can_use_tool`` (``decision_reason_type: "mode"``) for a non-plan-file
    ``Write`` instead of blocking it, and this classification lets stage 6
    approve it — see the 2026-09-30 findings addenda (#383, §Q3a). Open
    issue; not changed by #751.

    ``auto``, ``dontAsk`` and ``bypassPermissions`` are False because each
    resolves permissions elsewhere: ``auto`` at the stage-4 classifier,
    ``dontAsk`` by auto-denying, ``bypassPermissions`` by skipping checks.

    ``None`` (no mode configured) is False — that run takes the legacy ``-p``
    path with no control channel at all, so no stage-6 request can arrive.
